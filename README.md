# ProceduralCocktailGenerator
Project to generate cocktail recipes procedurally in JavaScript.  Currently, the system supports black/white lists,
and generates cocktails based on the Old Fashioned, Martinis, Margaritas, White Russians, Manhattans, Mojitos, 
Mai Tais, and Daiquris.

The project is ongoing, but there should be several big updates over the next few days / weeks / months!


Currently, the system is an expert, stochastic, context-sensative and sometimes tree-adjoining grammar.
